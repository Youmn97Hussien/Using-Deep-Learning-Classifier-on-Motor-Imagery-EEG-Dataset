# Using-Deep-Learning-Classifier-on-Motor-Imagery-EEG-Dataset
## Data Collection
EEG data was collected during sleep, capturing brain signals for motor imagery tasks.

## Pre-Sleep and Post-Sleep Data
The dataset includes both pre-sleep and post-sleep data. Pre-sleep data is used for training and validation, while post-sleep data is reserved for testing.

## Python for Classification
The classification model is implemented using Python, leveraging deep learning techniques.

## Multi-Channel Data
The EEG dataset consists of multi-channel brain signals, providing a comprehensive view of neural activity during motor imagery tasks.
